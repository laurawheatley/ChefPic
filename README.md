# ChefPic

_ChefPic_ (or as we also like to call _SnapChef_ or _WatsonThis_) is an Android app using IBM Watson's visual recognition software to provide recipes for a given food item.
A user simply takes a picture of a meal, and the picture is automatically analyzed and classified by the visual recognition API. Once it has been identified, recipes relating to (or even the meal itself) is shown to the user, with external links to the full recipe.

Created by Laura Wheatley, Anthony Palmeri, Anthony Laye, and Derek Yu for ConUHacks III.
